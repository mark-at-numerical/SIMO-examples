To run your first example:
--------------------------

1. In the Console (the panel with a green Run button), choose "Settings" in the menu.

2. Look for "WORKING FOLDER".

3. Change the working folder to, e.g., Examples/Plot2D.

4. Go back to the Console. Enter "p2_ex1" in the text area next to the Run button.

5. Tap the Run button to run.

6. If you see the error message 'Variable "p2_ex1" or file p2_ex1.m not found', you probably did not change the working folder correctly.

7. Swipe to the Plot area to see the result (two periodic waves).

8. Similarly, you can try "p2_ex2" and "p2_ex3".

9. Change the working folder again to try more examples.

Enjoy SIMO :)
